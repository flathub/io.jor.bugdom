  <description>
    <p>This is Pangea Software's Bugdom updated to run on modern operating systems. This version, at https://github.com/jorio/bugdom, is approved by Pangea Software.</p>
    <p>The Story</p>
    <p>The Bugdom was once a peaceful place ruled by the Rollie Pollies and the Lady Bugs, but not long ago the Bugdom was overthrown by the clan of the Fire Ants. After recruiting other bugs to help fight for them, they captured all of the Lady Bugs and are holding them prisoner. The leader of the Fire Ants, the new king of the Bugdom, is King Thorax. Once he is defeated, the Bugdom will return to the peaceful place it used to be.</p>
    <p>You are Rollie McFly, the only remaining bug capable of saving the Lady Bugs and restoring peace to the Bugdom. Rollie has been hiding in the Lawn area of the Bugdom and will need to travel far to get to the Ant Hill where the battle with King Thorax must take place. There will be water to cross, bugs to ride, and plenty of enemy forces to defeat, but once the Fire Ants and King Thorax have been defeated, you will become the new ruler of the Bugdom and peace will be restored.</p>
